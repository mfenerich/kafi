*kafi* brings the two worlds of Kafka and files together. It stands for "(Ka)fka and (Fi)les" (plus "Kafi" is the Swiss name for a coffee or a coffee place).

What can *kafi* do for you?
* it makes debugging Kafka-based applications a breeze
* it is useful for data scientists building data pipelines, bringing files from local disk, S3 or Azure Blob Storage to Kafka and vice versa etc.

*kafi* is the successor of [kash.py](https://github.com/xdgrulez/kash.py) which is the successor of [streampunk](https://github.com/xdgrulez/streampunk).
