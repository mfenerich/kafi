*Kafi* closes the gap between Kafka and files. It stands for "(Ka)fka and (fi)les" (plus "Kafi" is the Swiss name for a coffee or a coffee place).

What can *Kafi* do for you?
* it makes debugging Kafka-based applications a breeze
* it is useful for data scientists for building asynchronous data pipelines, or for synchronously bringing files from local disk, S3 or Azure Blob Storage to Kafka and vice versa etc.

*Kafi* is the successor of [kash.py](https://github.com/xdgrulez/kash.py) which is the successor of [streampunk](https://github.com/xdgrulez/streampunk).

Documentation coming soon... for now, please use the kash.py documentation and the help function from Python...

Here is a presentation I gave at Current 2024 (Sep 24) and ZÃ¼rich Apache Kafka Meetup (Nov 24) about Kafi: https://github.com/xdgrulez/cur24 You can also find a recording of the Current 2024 session here: https://www.confluent.io/resources/generic/current-2024-recap/
